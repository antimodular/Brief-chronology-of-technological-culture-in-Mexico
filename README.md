# Brief chronology of technological culture in Mexico

[RAFAEL LOZANO-HEMMER](http://lozano-hemmer.com) · Feburary 1, 2023

This is an incomplete and idiosyncratic list of intersections of technology and culture in Mexico compiled by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer and Tracy Valcourt.

### From Teosinte to Corn - 7,000 BC

Corn is the result of artificial selection of grains of Teosinte grass over many generations of indigenous people in Guerrero, around 9,000 years ago. Without the artificial selection of seeds Teosinte would not have naturally developed into the large corn cobs that we know today.

### Milpa - 3,000 BC

Biodiverse Mesoamerican agriculture system that offers nutritionally and environmentally complementary crops, typically corn (carbohydrates), beans (lysine and typtophan to make proteins), cucurbita pepo squash (vitamins) and avocados (fats).

### Banderoles and Volutes - ca 650 BC

In art history a speech scroll (also called a volute, banderole or phylactery) is an illustrative device denoting speech, song, or other types of sound. The device was in use by artists within Mesoamerican cultures from as early as 650 BC until after the in the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. While similar European medieval speech-scrolls were drawn as if they were an actual strip of parchment, Mesoamerican volutes follow the rules of fluid-dynamics such as Navier-Stokes equations, creating eddies and turbulence in the air.

### Mayan Zero - ca 350

The number zero was used as a placeholder by Mayans over 100 years before it first was used algorithmically in India in 458. Contrary to the Indian zero, which represented emptiness or vacuum, in Mexico zero represented totality, everything.

### Uxmal - ca 500

The ancient Mayan city features The Governor's Palace which is a classic example of archaeoastronomy, as it is oriented so that every eight years Venus intersects it as seen from the Cehtzuc pyramid 5Km away. This is no coincidence as the Palace has almost 400 glyphs signifying Venus on its facade.

### Chinampas - ca 1150

Artificial islands or floating gardens created by interweaving reeds, stakes, fertile arable soil, drainage systems, and often secured and protected by bonpland willow and cypress trees. Chinampas were developed by the Aztecs to extend land and grow crops that needed no irrigation and could yield up to 7 harvests a year.

### Alfonso Luis Herrera - 1904

Developed an experimental science called plasmogeny, concerned with the origin of protoplasm, the living material of which all animals and plants are made. He experimented with creating artificial cells that could have life-like behaviours, for example with sulphobe films, composed of formaldehyde and thiocyanates. He demonstrated the non-biological synthesis of organic compounds, but did not define the boundary between living and inanimate matter.

### Eduardo Urzáiz - 1919

Writer from Yucatán, author of the dystopian science fiction novel "Eugenia", a precedent to "Brave New World" (1932), "Nineteen Eighty Four" (1948) and "Farenheit 451" (1953). Set in 2218 in the supposedly perfect town of "Villautopia", capital of Central America, eugenics has reached a point where men become pregnant with selected fertilized eggs and family is no longer needed, replaced by groups built by affinity.

### Estridentismo - Maples Arce, List Arzubide, Lira, Gallardo, and others - 1921

_Estridentismo_ (Stridentism), was an avant-garde artistic and techno-optimist movement founded by poet Manuel Maples Arce. The arrival of radio transmission in Mexico was spearheaded by this movement, who did the first radio broadcasts in the country starting in 1921.

### David Alfaro Siqueiros - 1932

Siqueiros was known for his innovative approach to painting using industrial approaches such as synthetic paints, spray guns, photography, and cement "frescoes". In 1932 he was the first to use electric projections to trace his drawings to an architectural scale, and in 1933 he used cameras and projectors placed in the different locations of visitors to create the immersive and polyperspective work "Ejercicio Plástico" in Argentina.

### Conlon Nancarrow - 1939

In 1939 composer Conlon Nancarrow began his works for mechanical player pianos, creating music which explored complex rhythmic variations beyond the ability of human performers. His polyphonic music derived from strata with different tempi, which required his pianos to be prepared and custom-built punching machines for his piano rolls. In 1947 he created a full robotic percussion orchestra, further bringing automation into his work.
